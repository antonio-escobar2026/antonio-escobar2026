Hello, my name is Antonio Escobar. I'm currently studying at The University of Texas at Dallas. 

I'm currently going through DSA, Unix Programming, and Statistics and have garnered a new appreciation for all of those subjects. 
My biggest interest as of right now is Statistics and Unix Programming. 

🔭 I’m currently working on the inner workings of a terminal-based text editor by studying kilo.
🌱 I’m currently learning threads, pipes, and forks using C.
